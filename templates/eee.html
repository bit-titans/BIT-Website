                    </div>
                    <p >The department of Electrical & Electronics Engineering came into existence along with the establishment of the institution in the year 1979. It is now headed by Dr. Pramila M.E. ,Ph.D., supported by highly qualified, experienced and dedicated staff.<br>

                      In this age of development in technology it is we the Electrical & Electronics engineers who hold the key to development with our horizon ranging from power generation to micro controllers. Founded in 1979, the department boasts of well equipped labs & a well qualified faculty. The department has endeavored in organizing regular field trips to various industries hence giving ample industrial exposure, thus integrating practical & theoretical knowledge.<br>
                      
                      To develop the overall personality of the students the Electrical Engineering Association (EEA) was formed. EEA holds various seminars ,technical talks & personality development programs to keep the students & staff updated with the latest developments. Several technical institutions like CPRI. PRDC etc, have conducted various lectures & workshops. To add to the credibility of the department various project papers have been acknowledged by the industry .The department has VTU recognized R&D centre and 6 faculty members from our department & also from other institutions have registered for Ph.D at this centre. Also 5 faculty members of our department have been awarded Ph.D. in diversified areas of EEE . Thus the department have strong sense of responsibility to provide an excellent technological education to the undergraduates and has been successful in providing platform to carry out R&D work. The students acquire the requisite knowledge for a successful carrier and the academic strength of the faculty is reflected by the alumini, many of whom are in the top echelons of industry and academia both in India and abroad.<br>
                      
                      Department has good placement record of 90% in top companies.<br>
                      
                      Department also has appreciable record of topping VTU twice i,e 1st rank with 07 Gold medals and secured 02 consecutive ranks (1st and 2nd rank) for the academic year 2013-14, 02 rank for the academic year 2015-16, 01 rank for the academic year 2016-17, two ranks during academic year 2017-18 .</p><br><br>
